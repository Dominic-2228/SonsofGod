  <h2>Lead of the Spirit</h2>
  <p>In this First part i want to Cover The idea of Son Ship. <p><em> In the Roman worldview, 
    sonship did not primarily point backward to begetting, 
    but forward to inheritance, 
    often through the medium of adoption.</em> In the time that Jesus was speaking, Jerusalem was under the Roman ruling and therefore,
  had a culture of Roman influence set on them. Jesus would speak of things that were natrual in the lives of those around Him, such as...</p> 
<!-- listing items that Jesus would use to relate to spiritual matters -->
  <ul>
  <li>Seeds and the action of harvesting crops</li>
  <li>The type of soil that one would build their house on</li>
  <li>The cultural standard of women and the value of a certain coin</li>
</ul>
 <p>
  Each thing that ive just mentioned, Jesus would use to relate a point in the natural, that they could understand,
  and point to the <strong>kingdom of God and Himself</strong>. 
</p>
<p>
  I want to bring back out the quote i stated earlier, Sonship did not point to the beggetting or a boy, but an adoption into a family. 
  Matthew 3: 17, 
  This is important to talk about because Jesus was the "<em><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm">Only Begotten Son</a></em>", 
  yet even though the man Christ Jesus is the Only begotten, we are still able to enter into sonship because of the work that Jesus did on the cross. 
  When we have the blood applied to our lives, God no longer sees the book of "Dominic", or the book of "whoever". God sees the lambs book, everything that the lamb did. 
</p>
<!-- ^^ Romans 8: 3-4 -->
 <p>
  Romans 8:14, This passage of scripture, written to the church at <em>Rome</em>, This is a key factor in seperating those that are Sons, Daughters, 
  and those that are disciples. There is nothing wrong with being a disciple, but there are levels deeper in God that He wants to take us. We start as lambs, 
  blindly following our shepard, but Jesus doesnt want us to stay here. Then we progress to other levels, Sons being one of them. This is a level were we start to walk in a place being
  led of God's Spirit, but we start to understand more around us, we start to see the patterns of the Spirit, things that God does, we start to pick up more on it. 
  its less of blind, and more relationship. God telling us things.  
 </p>
 <h2>I Only Do That Which I See My Father Do</h2>
 <h3><em>Doth not even nature itself teach you... - 1 Corinthians 11:14.</em></h3>
 <p>I want you to take a look at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEEGAkrbvFw">video</a>. I dont mean to take 1 Corinthians 11:14, 
  out of context. It is speaking about a man having Long hair being a disgrace, yet in this verse it does show us that there are certain things in nature 
  that we can learn from, certain things that nature itself can teach us. We just witness the fact that an orangatang spends up to 8 years training a developing 
  their young child to be ready to take on the World. The Roman Idea of education to their children was primaily put on the Father, They indeed would hire tutors, 
  but that was only after the Father was not able to educate his child. 
</p>
<p>
  Two examples of nature and society in the time of Christ that shows us the importance of the Father, or the One who has begotten the child. The place that this child
  learns is in the presence of the one that takes <em>responsibility</em> for the child. This is the same way that Jesus Christ, God manifested, God shown in the Flesh, teaches us. 
</p>
  <h3><em>for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. - John 5:19.</em></h3>
  <p>This goes back to being led of God's Spirit. God will teach us through His Word, and give us the oppurtunity to live out His Word, in our day-to-day lives. 
  Jesus in his humanity, said He can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do. That is the same with us. There is nothing that we can do without God in our lives. 
  It takes the Father, Our Father, Jesus Christ to do a transformation in our lives that leads us to becoming the sons of God. A desire that takes us from being content with being 
  sheep, or disciples, and takes us to a deeper level with God, a level of Sonship. 
</p>
<p>
  John 5:20, "For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth", This is a level of love, but also a level of relationship that God has with the Son, and will give to His Sons, 
  that exeedes a blind walk, "God will show him all things". This is a similar level to freindship, Genesis 18:17, <em>The LORD said, â€œShall I keep secret from Abraham [My friend and servant] what I am going to do,</em>,
  There was a level that Abraham was at with God that God did not want to hid certain things from Him, He wanted to tell Him certain things. A level of love, a level of relationship
  that Abraham had with God. With this relationship, Abraham used the influence that he had with God, and interceeded for Sodom and Gomorrah. 
</p>
<h3>Sonship Is<em>Not</em>About You</h3>
<p>Imagine you are in this walk with God, leading a group of people. God calls you to a fast, starts speaking to you in prayer one day in your home. And says,
  "Im sick of the sin and the hard heart of the congregation i ordainded you to lead, there not getting any better, im just going to kill them all". 
  What do you say? <em>Exodus 32:31b-32 Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written.</em>,
  Moses was a man who was presented with this very question, but the answer he gave was an answer of intercession, it was an answer of confession and an answer of forgiveness. 
  An answer that gets God's attention, and an answer that he only knew about because He was at a different level of relationship with God than everyone else. 
  This is a place that God is calling all of us too. A level with Him that He can be open to us, He can share His heart, and He knows that we will respond, just as He has taught us. 
  The response that leads people to Him, and not away. A response that moves from critisism to salvation. It's the response our Father would have. 
  This is a place that God longs for His people to walk in, a level of relationship so different from the world, and so close to Him. This is a place of <strong>Sonship</strong>.
